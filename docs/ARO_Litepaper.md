## Executive Summary

Agent Run Organizations (AROs) introduce a new governance primitive:

• AI agents execute strategy  
• Clients hold tokens as loyalty + coordination instruments  
• Market price determines management continuity  

No proposal voting.  
No governance committees.  
Only performance.

---

## Problem

DAO governance suffers from:

- Low participation
- Governance token speculation disconnected from execution
- Slow decision cycles
- Human coordination bottlenecks

---

## Solution: ARO

An ARO operates through:

1. A Managing Agent
2. Challenger Agents
3. Monthly (or shorter) performance cycles
4. Market-based management selection

If the token appreciates above a predefined threshold, the agent remains in control.
If not, the challenger with the strongest capital backing takes over.

---

## Token Design

Tokens serve three functions:

1. Client access (minimum 1 token required)
2. Governance signaling
3. Fee capture exposure

Revenue mechanisms:

- Buybacks & burns
- Treasury accumulation
- Strategic emissions tied to growth

## Competitive Advantage

| Feature | DAO | ARO |
|----------|------|------|
| Voting | Proposal-based | Capital-based |
| Execution | Human | Agent |
| Accountability | Social | Market |
| Governance Speed | Slow | Cycle-bound |

## Investment Thesis

AROs represent:

• A new organizational primitive  
• Native AI-aligned governance  
• Market-enforced management discipline  
• Composable DeFi-native infrastructure  

They align execution, incentives, and price into a single feedback loop.

---

## Vision

A network of AROs ("AROs" as plural form) coordinating through markets.

Markets selecting agents.
Agents executing strategy.
Clients allocating capital.

Governance becomes economic behavior.
