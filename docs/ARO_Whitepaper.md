# Agent Run Organizations (ARO)

## A Market-Native Governance Framework

---

## Abstract

Agent Run Organizations (AROs) propose a new governance primitive for decentralized systems. Instead of human committees or token-based proposal voting, AROs operate through AI agents whose authority is determined by market performance.

Tokenholders are clients of the organization. Tokens function as loyalty, coordination, and signaling instruments. Governance does not occur through formal proposal voting, but through capital allocation behavior: holding, buying, selling, or reallocating tokens to competing agents.

Unlike DAOs operating under futarchy methodologies — where prediction markets or governance tokens may or may not directly control execution — ARO tokens directly determine operational authority through market outcomes. Clients “vote with their wallet,” and price movement becomes the accountability mechanism.

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Tokenholders are clients.**
2. **Tokens are utility-based loyalty instruments**, not abstract governance ballots.
3. **Governance occurs through capital allocation behavior.**
4. **AI agents execute strategy.**
5. **Performance is measured by token price movement over defined cycles.**

---

## 2. Organizational Structure

An ARO consists of:

- A **Managing Agent**
- A configurable number of **Challenger Agents**
- Tokenholding clients
- A defined governance cycle (default: monthly)

The Managing Agent operates the organization and may deploy sub-agents for execution.

Challenger Agents propose alternative strategies and may assume management if selected by market dynamics.

---

## 3. Governance Cycle

### 3.1 Default Cycle

- The system begins with a **monthly governance cycle**.
- The Managing Agent may propose **shorter cycles**, but cycles can never exceed the original duration.
- This ensures increasing responsiveness without allowing governance slowdown.

### 3.2 Reporting

At the end of each cycle, the Managing Agent publishes:

- Operational report
- Performance metrics
- Next-cycle strategy
- Target token appreciation threshold (X%)

### 3.3 Market-Based Evaluation

Clients express approval by:

- Holding tokens
- Buying additional tokens
- Selling tokens
- Allocating tokens to Challenger Agents

If token price appreciation ≥ target threshold → Managing Agent remains.

If appreciation < threshold → The Challenger Agent with the strongest token backing becomes the new Managing Agent.

Governance is therefore continuous and capital-driven.

---

## 4. Challenger Agent Framework

### 4.1 Number of Agents

- An initial number of Challenger Agents is defined at deployment.
- Additional agents may be created via proposals.
- The system must include limits or pruning mechanisms to remove agents that fail to gain support across multiple cycles, keeping the system manageable for clients.

### 4.2 Stability Mechanism

If a Managing Agent proposes unreasonably short cycles, there will always be at least one Challenger Agent that mirrors the previous successful configuration.

Clients can reallocate tokens to that agent if they prefer stability.

This ensures:
- No forced acceleration of governance cycles.
- Continuous fallback to the last proven structure.
- Market-based discipline on cycle manipulation.

---

## 5. Sub-Agent Structure

The Managing Agent may deploy sub-agents responsible for:

- Risk management
- Treasury optimization
- Product execution
- Liquidity strategy
- Research and development

Sub-agents operate under the authority of the Managing Agent but remain transparent in reporting.

---

## 6. Client Access Model

Only wallets holding **at least 1 token** may interact with the organization as official clients.

This includes:

- Access to products or services
- Participation in governance cycles
- Allocation to Challenger Agents
- Interaction with protocol infrastructure

The organization may operate real economic services such as:

- A decentralized exchange (DEX)
- DeFi primitives
- Financial infrastructure
- Other value-generating systems determined by the Managing Agent

Tokens therefore represent:

- Client membership
- Coordination rights
- Economic alignment

---

## 7. Tokenomics Framework

### 7.1 Token Role

The token serves three core functions:

1. Client access credential  
2. Governance signal  
3. Fee-capture exposure  

### 7.2 Emissions

- Initial supply defined at genesis.
- Emissions may be tied to measurable value creation.
- Emission adjustments may be proposed by Managing or Challenger Agents.

### 7.3 Fee Capture

Revenue generated by the organization may be allocated to:

- Buyback and burn mechanisms
- Treasury reserves
- Strategic reinvestment
- Performance-aligned emissions

Token price becomes the primary signal of organizational confidence.

## 8. Comparison to Futarchy-Based DAO Models

| Feature | Futarchy-Based DAO | ARO |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Governance Mechanism | Prediction markets | Direct capital allocation |
| Token Role | Often governance-only | Client + utility + signal |
| Execution | Frequently human-mediated | Agent-executed |
| Market Link | Indirect | Direct |
| Accountability | Market prediction | Real price outcome |

In futarchy-based systems, governance tokens may not be directly linked to execution, and may function independently from operational authority.

In AROs, token performance directly determines management continuity.

Markets do not predict outcomes — they select operators.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Agent Run Organizations align execution, incentives, and governance into a single feedback loop:

- Agents execute.
- Clients allocate capital.
- Price determines control.

No committee voting.  
No governance theater.  
No separation between decision and consequence.

Governance becomes economic behavior.
