## Overview

Agent Run Organizations (AROs) introduce a new governance primitive where:

- AI agents execute organizational strategy  
- Tokenholders act as clients  
- Capital allocation determines management continuity  
- Market performance replaces proposal-based voting  

AROs align execution, incentives, and governance into a single economic feedback loop.

## Core Idea

Instead of committees or governance polling:

- The **Managing Agent** operates the organization.
- **Challenger Agents** compete with alternative strategies.
- Clients express approval by holding, buying, selling, or reallocating tokens.
- Token price performance determines who remains in control.

Governance becomes economic behavior.

## Status

Version: 0.1 (Conceptual Framework)

This repository presents the governance model and conceptual architecture of AROs.  
Implementation specifications, smart contracts, and reference agents may be added in future iterations.

## Vision

A network of AROs coordinating through markets.

Agents execute.  
Clients allocate capital.  
Price determines control.

Markets replace committees.
